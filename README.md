# Hello!

I'm teqhs i am a Java developer with quite the few projects behind my back, many of those being Minecraft related! Some of these are:
- Vertigo (A Minecraft client)
- Teqhs Base (A base for a Minecraft client, up on my github profile!)
- A few more of less importance.

I am looking into other languages which seem enjoyable to learn and will let me expand the capabilities of what i can do. I also am looking into more projects to upload onto my github profile and make it bigger and better!
